This readme file relates to images presented in this .zip file.

There are three different georeferenced images presented displaying Tellus geophysical data.
.grd files are Geosoft grid files and can be opened in: GIS softwares including Geosoft, ArcGIS(only with Geosoft ArcGIS plugin) and MAPINFO.
.tiff files are a georeferenced coloured raster files
.gxf are ASCII grid files and are an interrogatable raster file.  This format can be opened in many GIS softwares.  Instructions on how to display in correct colour ramp in ArcGIS and QGIS are in the pdf included in this .zip
